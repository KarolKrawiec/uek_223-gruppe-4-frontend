## How to start the backend

You simply need to run this command:

## Cypress tests
We wanted to do E2E Cypress tests for our use case, which we described in the documentation, but it did not work due to installation errors. We tried many steps to set up Cypress but it did not work. The problem was not with writing the tests but with the installation. 
We used the following commands:

npm install cypress --save-dev


yarn add cypress --dev


cypress install


We wrote a test anyway, but we couldn't validate whether it passed because Cypress didn't build.
